# Notes on Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components in React

A controlled component is one where React controls the form input through state, making it suitable for validation and dynamic UI updates. An uncontrolled component lets the DOM manage the input state, and React accesses the value via refs when needed. Controlled components are preferred for complex forms, while uncontrolled components are useful for simple or performance-sensitive cases.
